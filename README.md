## ***Description:***
What things does a potential home buyer consider before purchasing a house? The location, the size of the property, the vicinity to offices, schools, parks, restaurants, hospitals, or the stereotypical white picket fence? What about the most important factor â€” the price?

## ***Problem Statement:***
By analyzing these **house data** we will determine the **house's approximate price**.

## ***Business Objectives & Constraints:***
1. The cost of misclassification can be high.Â¶
