# House-Price-Prediction-Data-Science-Project



## ***Description:***
What things does a potential home buyer consider before purchasing a house? The location, the size of the property, the vicinity to offices, schools, parks, restaurants, hospitals, or the stereotypical white picket fence? What about the most important factor â€” the price?
